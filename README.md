# Hello-World
Collection of ideas for my website 

Hello reader,

My name is Munodiwa Bore. I am studying to become an electrical engineer. I just discovered however, that I have a bigger love for coding. Which is why I am here to learn more from this vast community of coders. I look forward to getting to know more about coding!
